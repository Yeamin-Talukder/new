The system is like that every ,every journal will must have a EDITOR-IN-CHIEF and it will assign when we create the journal.
so paper published in that journal will go to the EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
 for that journal. Then he  can assign new editor for that journal or the can do the work flow all by himself. when createing new journal we can assign any user to EDITOR-IN-CHIEF. Add a user searching option here by mail because there can be many user in our system
